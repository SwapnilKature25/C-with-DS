Finding strong no or not?
1, 2, 145
1 factorial is 1
2 factorial is 2
145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
123 = 1! + 2! + 3! = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9  not a strong no

Eg: printing 1..n palindrome no’s and count
Eg: 1 to 50 palindromes are 1-9, 11,22,33,44 - 13
Eg: printing 1..n prime no’s and count
Eg: 1-20 prime no’s 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19 - 8
Eg: printing n to n prime no’s and count
Eg: 10 to 20 primes – 11, 13, 17, 19 – 4 primes
